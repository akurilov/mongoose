# General
* Indent code with TAB having width of 4 characters
* Code line width: 120 characters
* Long line example:
```java
nextSubTask = new PartialDataIoTaskImpl<>(
	originIndex, ioType, nextPart, srcPath, dstPath, credential, i, this
);
```
* If interface is named `Foo` then:
  * Abstract implementation should be named as `FooBase`
  * Default concrete implementation should be names as `FooImpl`
* Any field/local variable should be *final* if possible

# Performance
Take care about the performance in the critical places:
* Avoid *frequent* objects instantiation
* Avoid unnecessary *frequent* allocation
* Avoid *frequent* method calls if possible
* Avoid deep call stack if possible
* Avoid I/O threads blocking
* Avoid anonymous classes in the time-critical code
* Avoid non-static inner classes in the time-critical code
* Use thread locals (encryption, string builders)
* Use buffering, buffer everything
* Use batch processing if possible
