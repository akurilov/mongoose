# Environment Requirements

* JRE 8+ or Docker
* OS open files limit is at least a bit higher than specified concurrency level
* Few gigabytes of free memory.

High-load tests may allocate up to 1-2 GB of the memory depending on the scenario.
* (Remote Storage) Connectivity with the endpoint nodes via the ports used
* (Distributed Mode) Connectivity with the remote nodes via port #1099 (RMI)
* (Remote Monitoring) Connectivity with the load controller via port #9010 (JMX)

# Deliverable Package

Mongoose is distributed as a single jar file from:
https://github.com/emc-mongoose/mongoose/releases/tag/latest

# Docker

Mongoose images are stored in the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/emcmongoose/)

## Base

**Note** that the base image contains the following storage driver implementations: fs, s3, atmos, swift

See the [extensions](#extensions) section to use any additional functionality

### Standalone

The base image may be used in the standalone mode:
```bash
docker run \
    --network host \
    emcmongoose/mongoose[-<TYPE>] [\
    <ARGS>]
```

### Distributed Mode

#### Node

First, it's necessary to start some node/peer services:
```bash
docker run \
    --network host \
    emcmongoose/mongoose \
    --run-node [\
    --test-step-node-port=<PORT>]
```

#### Run

To invoke the run in the distributed mode it's necessary to specify the additional node/peer addresses:
```bash
docker run \
    --network host \
    emcmongoose/mongoose \
    --load-step-node-addrs=<ADDR1,ADDR2,...> [\
    <ARGS>]
```

### Extensions

#### Provided

##### Load Step Implementations

* Linear
* Pipeline
* Weighted

##### Storage Drivers

* s3: Amazon S3 generic storage
* atmos: EMC Atmos cloud storage
* swift: OpenStack Swift cloud storage
* fs: Filesystem storage driver

#### External

| Image Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| mongoose-storage-driver-cifs | Base image + CIFS storage driver implementation (planned) |
| [mongoose-storage-driver-hdfs](https://github.com/emc-mongoose/mongoose-storage-driver-hdfs) | Base image + HDFS storage driver implementation |
| mongoose-storage-driver-nfs | Base image + NFS storage driver implementation (planned) |

## Additional Notes

### Logs Sharing

The example below mounts the host's directory `./log` to the container's
`/root/.mongoose/<VERSION>/log` (where mongoose holds its log files).

```bash
docker run \
    --network host \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/log,target=/root/.mongoose/<VERSION>/log
    emcmongoose/<IMAGE> \
    [<ARGS>]
```

### Debugging

The example below starts the Mongoose in the container with remote
debugging capability via the port #5005.

```bash
docker run \
    --network host \
    --expose 5005
    --entrypoint /opt/mongoose/entrypoint-debug.sh \
    emcmongoose/<IMAGE> \
    [<ARGS>]
```
