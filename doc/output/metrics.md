# 1. Load Average

Load average metrics records are thought to be produced periodically to monitor the load step state
in the nearly real time mode. The producing period is configurable (`output-metrics-average-period`)
and the default value is "10s" (10 seconds). Setting this period to 0 will disable the load average
metrics output at all.

## 1.1. Console

The average metrics are displayed in the console in the form of ASCII table for better readability.
The header is displayed each 20 rows by default. Use the
`output-metrics-average-table-header-period` configuration parameter to set the custom value.

Table output example:

### 1.1.1. Table Fields Description

Field Name            | Description
----------------------|------------
Step Name             | The configured step name. Automatic value is used if not configured obviously. Note that only last 10 characters are displayed in the table.
Timestamp             | The datetime of the record output in the "yyMMddHHmmss" format (year is specified by the 2 last digits)
Op Type               | Load operation type. Colored for readability.

Count / Failed        | The count of the items processed with a failure.
Step Time [s]         | The test step elapsed time in seconds. Note that the step elapsing more than 115 days will cause the cell overflow as far as only 7 characters are available for the output.
Last Rate / [op/s]    | The moving average operations per second rate for the last period (10 seconds by default).
Last Rate / [MB/s]    | The moving average megabytes per second rate for the last period (10 seconds by default).

output the configuration parameter `output-metrics-average-persist` should be set to "false". Note that the file output
for the metrics is always disabled for the load step slices (i.e. on the additional/remote nodes in the distributed

* The console summary is displayed only on the entry node. It's not displayed on the additional nodes in the distributed mode.
* The equation (CONFIGURED_CURRENCY_LEVEL * DRIVER_COUNT * ELAPSED_TIME / OPERATIONS_DURATION_SUM) may be used as efficiency estimate.
* *Mean* rates are calculated as current total count of items/bytes divided by current elapsed time.
* *Last* rates are calculated as [exponentially decaying moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average) where

  ![alpha](http://i.piccy.info/i9/c211a78abdaeec65da61020c5dc83008/1485332899/627/722110/CodeCogsEqn.png)

  and "t" is the configured *load-metrics-period* parameter.

## 2.2. Files

The summary metrics produced at the end of each load step and the results are written to a CSV file `metrics.total.csv`.
The layout is the same as for average metrics file output. To disable the summary metrics file output the configuration
parameter `output-metrics-summary-persist` should be set to "false". Note that the file output for the metrics is always
disabled for the load step slices (i.e. on the additional/remote nodes in the distributed mode).

# 3. Operation Traces

The metrics for each load operation (request either file operation).

## 3.1. Console

The console output is absent.

## 3.2. Files

The file output is disabled by default.
To enable the file output, set the `output-metrics-trace-persist` configuration parameter to "true".
**Output file**: `op.trace.csv` with *dynamic path*.

# 4. Threshold

Mongoose controls the concurrency level by accounting the active channels at any moment of the time.
The channel may be an open file either established network connection. The channel is active when
it's assigned for an operation execution which is marked as active.

When Mongoose test step starts there's some short delay before the warmup is done and all channels
are busy with operations (active). It's expected that the performance rates are lower during this
warmup time range. Moreover, at the test step end some channels may remain active with the operation
while other channels are not selected for new operations.

To address these issues, it's necessary to account the performance metrics only while the active
channels count is higher than the configured threshold value (***threshold reached*** condition).
However, it's possible that the test step will never reach the *threshold reached* condition due to
some reasons (errors, very short operations, etc).

* Let the configured threshold be ***P***.
* Let configured concurrency level be ***C*** which is >0 and current busy channel count be ***N***.
* The *threshold reached* condition is *true* if N >= C * P

Metrics Manager:

1. Wait until all the storage drivers are in the *threshold reached* state
2. Create separate metrics instance and start the additional metrics accounting and aggregation
3. Wait until any storage driver exits the *threshold reached* state
4. Stop the additional metrics accounting and aggregation
5. Output the summary for the additional metrics

The load threshold value may be from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
The configuration parameter is `output-metrics-threshold`

CLI example: account the additional (threshold) metrics while the actual concurrency level is more than 80:
```bash
java -jar mongoose-<VER>.jar \
    --storage-driver-limit-concurrency=100 \
    --output-metrics-threshold=0.8
```

## 4.1. Console

1. The threshold state entrance is marked with the following log message:

   `<CONTEXT>: the threshold of <COUNT> active load operations count is reached, starting the additional metrics accounting`

2. The threshold state exit is marked with the following log message:

   `<CONTEXT>: the active load operations count is below the threshold of <COUNT>, stopping the additional metrics accounting`

## 4.2. Files

The layout is the same as usual metrics log files layout, the log file name is: `metrics.threshold.total.csv`. Note that
the file output for the metrics is always disabled for the load step slices (i.e. on the additional/remote nodes in the
distributed mode).
